## TWC Assignment 📑

Hello, 
As we discussed on our quick chat, your next step will be to complete a task to test your knowledge of design, analytics, React and basics of a Rest api.
Your task will be to build a very basic full stack system. The initial screen will be a login page. Once the user signs in, they will be greeted with a welcome message and a button to add a “contact”. Once this button is clicked a form has to be filled to add a “contact”. A list of all “contacts” must be shown in a table along with the ability to edit and delete them.
